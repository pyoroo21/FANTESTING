# Requirements Sample App

This sample app shows to the developers how to add Apps requirements to their Apps. "Apps Requirements" are a neat feature that allows your App to install business rules, ticket fields, and all other resources that it might need to function properly.

This App will add requirements as well as "reference" those requirements from within the App.

For an App that only creates requirements and nothing else please see [Requirements Only Sample App](./../requirements_only_sample_app)

**Notes:**
- Requirements aren't installed when running the app locally on the ZAT server. However, for testing purposes, you can install the app as a private app and then use the zat update command to make updates to the installed app. See [Updating an installed app](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/apps-v2/using_sdk#updating-an-installed-app).
- If you have multiple ticket forms you will need to manually add the ticket field created by this app to one of the forms.

### The following information is displayed:

* Create Apps requirements
