# Requirements Only Sample App

This sample app shows to the developers how to add Apps requirements to their Apps. "Apps Requirements" are a neat feature that allows your App to install business rules, ticket fields, and all other resources that it might need to function properly.

This App will only add requirements. It has no other logic or features.

For an App that contains both please see [Requirements Sample App](./../requirements_sample_app)

**Note:** Requirements aren't installed when running the app locally on the ZAT server. However, for testing purposes, you can install the app as a private app and then use the zat update command to make updates to the installed app. See [Updating an installed app](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/apps-v2/using_sdk#updating-an-installed-app).

### The following information is displayed:
