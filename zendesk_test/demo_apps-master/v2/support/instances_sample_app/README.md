# Instances API Sample App

This sample app uses the [Instances API](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/apps-v2/api_reference#client.instanceguid) to add a template comment from the background location when the comment box is empty. It also uses the `{ autoLoad: false }` location option to avoid rendering the iframe in the ticket_sidebar location.
